#### 1. `Single responsibility` Principle
##### - class should only have one job

#### 2. `Open-closed` Principle
##### - Objects `open for extension`
##### - Objects `closed for modification`
##### - add new features without breaking existing code

#### 3. `Liskov substitution` Principle
##### - every subclass should be substitutable for their base class


#### 4. `Interface segregation` principle
##### - we should not force the class to implement an interface
##### - we should create separate interface for that

#### 5. `Dependency Inversion` principle
##### - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules
